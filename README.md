Nomster-Web
=
Nomster-Web is a simple [Poylmer](http://polymer-project.org)-based web frontend for the Nomster ecosystem. At the moment, the ui is a playground to play around with the Poylmer framework and the Material Design. The source is based on the 'Getting Started' tutorial of [polymer-project.org](https://www.polymer-project.org/docs/start/getting-the-code.html).

How to install
=
1. `npm install -g bower`
2. `bower install`
3. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (or a similar http-server) 
4. Browse to [http://locahost:8000](http://locahost:8000)

The current version of nomster-web works without the server. It ships a dummy datasource.

What's Nomster?
